Handwritten Digit Classifier for MNIST Data Set

This project is a tool for creating and training neural networks to classify individual handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset. Networks can be built to have any number of hidden layers and neurons with those layers. The hyperparameters (weights, biases, and layer sizes) of trained networks can be saved and loaded for future use upon completion of training. The implementation of the network training is adapted from Michael Nielsen's version from his Neural Networks and Deep Learning book.

Installation

This project relies heavily on numpy, so please make sure that you install it first.
